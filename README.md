## Description

This project began as a React app, then Redux was added in order to streamline the state management. Since then, the code has been optimized for Performance, SEO, Accessibility, and Best Practices as you will see in the Lighthouse Audit below. It also received a perfect score as a Progressive Web App. This was a very fun project and I'm excited to use what I've learned about Progressive Web Apps.
